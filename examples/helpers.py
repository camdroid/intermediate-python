"""
Suitable for hacking after class 3.

This file contains functions to help you open and process text files

It also provides a function for obtaining the set of English words. This can be
used to help with anything you might want to do with spell-checking or
determing if a word is valid according to the dictionary.

N.B. The dictionary isn't necessarily exhaustive and isn't meant to be
authoritative, just a useful example to work with.
